# Boids Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a **Boids Simulation**, a simple agent-based model for simulating flocking behavior as set out by **C. Reynolds** in the 1987 paper **Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model** pubsihed in _Computer Graphics_. The simulation uses **Pygame** for rendering and **NumPy** for vector calculations.

## Features
- **Flocking Behavior**: Implements **collision avoidance, velocity matching, and flock centering**.
- **Wall Avoidance**: Boids bounce off screen edges.
- **Random Initialization**: Boids start with randomized positions and velocities centered around the middle of the screen.
- **Behaviour Customisation**: Boid behaviour can be set at the flock level from provided rulesets.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Running the Simulation
To run the Boids simulation, execute:
```sh
python sky.py
```
