# Boids Simulation

## Overview
This project implements a **Boids Simulation**, a simple agent-based model for simulating flocking behavior as set out by **C. Reynolds** in the 1987 paper **Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model** as published in _Computer Graphics_. The simulation uses **Pygame** for rendering and **NumPy** for vector calculations.

## Features
- **Flocking Behavior**: Implements **collision avoidance, velocity matching, and flock centering**.
- **Wall Avoidance**: Boids bounce off screen edges.
- **Random Initialization**: Boids start with randomized positions and velocities centered around the middle of the screen.
- **Behaviour Customisation**: Boid behaviour can be set at the flock level from provided rulesets.
    -Basic Flocking: As set out in the 1987 paper.
    -Non-Flocking: No motion, as a control.
    -Directional Flocking: Additional flocking rules implemented for surrounding boid detection to be modified as suggested in 1987 paper.
    -Omniscient Flocking: Flocking rules but with each boid knowing every boid location.

## Simulation Control
- **Numbers**: Select the flock to be altered.
- **q**: Exit the simulation.
- **f, n, d, o**: Flocking modes basic, non-flocking, directional, and omniscient respectivly.
- **Up and Down**: Increase and decrease flock speed.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Running the Simulation
To run the Boids simulation, execute:
```sh
python sky.py
```

## To Do
-Populate templates in boidBehaviour.py.
-Add in greater UI interactability.
-Integrate collaboration.
-Allow 0 to control all flocks simultainiously.
-Add maximum limit of 9 flocks.
